// Using JavaScript, write a program to find the nearest common parent of any two nodes in a binary tree.
// Aside from stacks and queues, do not use any data structures that are built into the language.

// Example
// Provided the function and example btree below, if ParentFinder was provided “leaf1” and “leaf3”, it 
// would return with “node1”. 
// Function ParentFinder(BTree B, Node n1, Node n2)

function BinaryTree(i) {
  self.value = i || null
  self.leftChild  = null
  self.rightChild = null
}
